### 6.1 Appendix A – NYAirline complaint system
The current system to deal with complaints and understand customers experience is managed over
a number of different data sources, oracle database and spreadsheet. The airline is recognising that
one of the key factors of the customer complaints are flights delay due to the weather, which is
unforeseen circumstances, but also the way complaints are managed by the airport staff. Complaints
raised by passengers are recorded against flights, passengers are required to raise a complaint
against each flight if they miss connections due to delays.
NYAirline have a number of KPI’s (Key Performance Indicators) you could consider. 

### KPI 1: Deliver a quality service
This KPI is concerned with the quality of their service to provide a good flight experience to
customers. In order to investigate the quality of their service they wish to investigate the outcomes
of flights.<br>
Examples of the types of reports they would like are:<br>
* Number of flights which are delayed per year per airport<br>
* Number of cancelled flights per year due to the bad weather<br>

You are expected to add four of our own reports to fit this KPI.

### KPI 2: Ensure customer satisfaction
This KPI is concerned with ensuring that customer complaints are dealt with adequately and do not
cause customers to not use them again. Examples of the types of reports they would like are: <br>
* Number of customer complaints per year per airport
* Total number of compensation per complaint type per year <br>

You are expected to add four of our own reports to fit this KPI. You may decide to come up with our own KPI. More of your own initiative with the task around this case study will bring you higher marks. For example you could include your own data set to compliment our data sets.<br>

* The file slights_2015_3000 contains about 3000 rows of data for flights in the year 2015.
* The file Flights_2016_2000 contains about 2000 rows of data for 2016.
* The complaints system data correlates to the data in flights files for 2015 and 2016*.
* The file 'Weather data 2015 to 2016' contains weather data for those years.
