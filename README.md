### 6.1 Appendix A – NYAirline complaint system
The current system to deal with complaints and understand customers experience is managed over
a number of different data sources, oracle database and spreadsheet. The airline is recognising that
one of the key factors of the customer complaints are flights delay due to the weather, which is
unforeseen circumstances, but also the way complaints are managed by the airport staff. Complaints
raised by passengers are recorded against flights, passengers are required to raise a complaint
against each flight if they miss connections due to delays.
NYAirline have a number of KPI’s (Key Performance Indicators) you could consider. 

### KPI 1: Deliver a quality service
This KPI is concerned with the quality of their service to provide a good flight experience to
customers. In order to investigate the quality of their service they wish to investigate the outcomes
of flights.<br>
Examples of the types of reports they would like are:<br>
⋅⋅* Number of flights which are delayed per year per airport<br>
⋅⋅* Number of cancelled flights per year due to the bad weather<br>
You are expected to add four of our own reports to fit this KPI.
